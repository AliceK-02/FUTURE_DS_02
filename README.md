This is my second task under my Data Science &amp; Analytics Internship at Future Interns. It was to analyze social media ad campaign data to assess performance. Using Power BI, I built an interactive dashboard to visualize key metrics such as CTR, Click rate, CPC and ROI. I've been able to level up my Power BI skills.
